            <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank"></p>

                The Cove
BY SETH ROSENBLOOM
I’m resting on a tide-bleached tree, and youare looking for stones. Like we’ve always done,from back when our son was little. But now,it’s up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lappedsmooth by the force of the moon. Pigmentedin colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiterswith ghostly rings. You’re too far away to hear,and there is no pain, so I won’t make a fuss. It’s justthumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numberson the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.My mind re-walks the trail through the forestto where the headlands open. Down the switchback.Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spidertowards the sky. We’re the only ones who hiked heretoday. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hoursbefore help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomenlike the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rushinto this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hillsthat shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purpleanemones. Home of endless give and take.
