            <h1>Grid Based Layout</h1>
            <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well.<br>
                The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout<br>
                the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank"> eleken.co</a></p>

                <h2>Soul Love</h2>
                <p><i>David Bowie</i></p>

                <p>Stone love, she kneels before the grave<br>
                A brave son, who gave his life to save the slogan<br>
                That hovers between the headstone and her eyes<br>
                For they penetrate her grieving<br>
                <p>New love, a boy and girl they talking<br>
                New words that only they can share in<br>
                New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts<br>
                To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning</p>
                <p>Love is careless in its choosing<br>
                Sweeping over across a baby<br>
                Love descends on those defenseless<br>
                Idiot love will spark the fusion<br>
                Inspirations have I none<br>
                Just to touch the flaming dove<br>
                All I have is my love of love<br>
                And love is not loving</p>
                <p>Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and<br>
                Told of love, and how my God on high is<br>
                All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves<br>
                By the blindness that surrounds him</p>

                <h2>Rock 'n' Roll Suicide</h2>
                <p><i>David Bowie</i></p>

                <p>Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth<br>
                You pull on your finger<br>
                Then another finger, then cigarette<br>
                The wall-to-wall is calling<br>
                It lingers, then you forget<br>
                Oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide</p>
                <p>You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it<br>
                And the clock waits so patiently on your song<br>
                You walk past the caf√©, but you don't eat<br>
                When you've lived too long<br>
                Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide</p>
                <p>Oh no, love, you're not alone<br>
                You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair<br>
                You got your head all tangled up<br>
                But if I could only make you care<br>
                Oh no, love, you're not alone<br>
                No matter what or who you've been<br>
                No matter when or where you've seen<br>
                All the knives seem to lacerate your brain<br>
                I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain<br>
                You're not alone</p>
